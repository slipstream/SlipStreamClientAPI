  ## Purpose

  The `run` namespace contains functions for interacting with SlipStream runs.

  It allows users to

   * Scale the components of the running application up and down,
   * Query the state of the run,
   * Query and set parameters of the application components and their instances,
   * Query parameters from global namespace (`ss:`), and
   * Terminate the run.

  Timeouts and intervals are in seconds.

  # SlipStraem run termininology

  There are three types of parameters on a run

   * Global parameter - `ss:tags`
   * Application component parameter - `webapp:ids`
   * Application component instance parameter - `webapp.1:hostname`

  where

   * `ss` is the global namespace of the run,
   * `webapp` is the name of the application component, which is referred to as `comp`
     in the API,
   * `webapp.1` is the name of the instance `1` of the application component `webapp`.


  ## Usage and examples

  The namespace can be bootstrapped either from `slipstream.context` file
  (in .ini format) or by explicitly providing the configuration to `contextualize!`.

  In the case of `slipstream.context`, the following structure and parameters
  are assumed

      [contextualization]

      # SlipStream endpoint.
      serviceurl = https://nuv.la

      # SlipStream user credentials
      username = foo
      password = bar

      # preferred over username and password
      cookie = key=val; Path:/

      # run UUID
      diid = 123

  This file is usually available on SlipStream managed VMs and is used by
  orchestrator and node executors.

  First call to any of the API functions searches and loads the
  contextualisation file.  All successive calls use the locally bound configuration.

  Explicitly calling `contextualize!` w/o parameters reload the contextualization
  and updates the configuration of the namespace.

  `contextualize!` can be called with a context map

      {:serviceurl \"https://nuv.la\"

       ;; run UUID
       :diid \"123\"

       :cookie \"key=val; Path:/\"

       :username \"foo\"
       :password \"bar\"}

  where either `:cookie` or `:username` and `:password` are mandatory.

  ### Examples

  Implicit bootstrap -- `slipstream.context` with the correct parameters
  should be in the search path.

      (require '[sixsq.slipstream.client.api.run :as r])

      (r/get-run-info)

  Manually define configuration and contextualize the namespace.

      (require '[sixsq.slipstream.client.api.run :as r])

      (def conf {:serviceurl \"https://nuv.la\"
                 :diid \"123-456\"
                 :username \"foo\"
                 :password \"bar\"})
      (rw/contextualize! conf)

      (r/get-run-info)"
