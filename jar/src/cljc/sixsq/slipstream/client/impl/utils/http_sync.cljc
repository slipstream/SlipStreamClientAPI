(ns ^{:no-doc true} sixsq.slipstream.client.impl.utils.http-sync
  "Simple synchronous wrapper around an HTTP library to produce consistent
  CRUD interface.

  The CRUD actions accept and produce `Ring`-style requests/responses.

  Examples of the request/response.

  ```
  GET using Basic authn
  req := {:accept :xml
          :basic-auth [\"user\" \"password\"]}
  resp := {:status 200
           :body \"<Hello :)>\"
           :headers {...}}
  ```

  ```
  GET using cookie
  req := {:accept :json
          :headers {:cookie cookie}}
  resp := {:status 200
           :body \"{\"Hello\": \":)\"}\"
           :headers {...}}
  ```

  ```clojure
  (:body (get \"https://httpbin.org/get\"))
  ```

  On HTTP error, throws ExceptionInfo with `:data` containing the full response.
  The response can be obtained with `(ex-data ex)`

  ```clojure
  (let [{:keys [status body]}
        (try
          (get \"https://httpbin.org/error\")
          (catch ExceptionInfo e (ex-data e)))
  ```
