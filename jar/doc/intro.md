# SlipStream Clojure Client API

SlipStream Clojure client library to query [SlipStream server API][ss-api].

## Usage

### Query SlipStream Run

Library looks for the configuration file named `slipstream.context` in the following places
and in defined the order

```
1. in the resources directory defined for the JVM
2. current directory
3. in user home directory
4. /opt/slipstream/client/bin/
5. /opt/slipstream/client/sbin/
6. system temporary directory

```

Here is the the example of `slipstream.context`

```
[contextualization]
diid = <uuid-of-slipstream-run>
cookie = com.sixsq.slipstream.cookie=<cookie-content> Path:/
serviceurl = https://nuv.la
node_instance_name = orchestrator-exoscale-ch-gva
```

Requre the run namespace and use the function to interact with the run

```clojre
(require '[com.sixsq.slipstream.client.api.run :as r])

(r/get-state)
(r/action-scale-up "web-server" 3)
(r/terminate)
```
